        <p class="plot-info">
            As you can see from this plot, California, Illinois and Texas have the highest rate of deaths as
            a result of mass shootings between 2014 and 2018. California takes the lead in regards to gun related injuries. If you
            are looking to avoid becoming the next victim of a mass shooting I would recommend moving to Hawaii, North Dakota, New Hampshire
            or perhaps Wyoming as these states have not yet encountered such a tragic incident.

            <h1 class="plot-info">Deaths (2014-2019)</h1>
        <a target="_blank" href="Resources/Figures/Mass_Shootings_Figures/total_deaths_by_year.png">
            <img src="https://github.com/SarahLewk/Gun-Death-Dashboard/blob/master/Resources/Figures/Mass_Shootings_Figures/total_deaths_by_year.png?raw=true" alt="Mass Shooting Deaths" class="plot-img">
            </a>
            <p class="plot-info">
            In total, there have been at least 1,997 mass shootings since 2014, with at least 2,281 deaths and
            8,313 wounded. So far in 2019 alone, there have been 72 mass shootings where 99 people have perished and 
            248 were among the wounded. Makes you think whether it's time to follow suit with other countries that have
            imposed strict gun laws such as Australia. They relinquished gun rights in 1996 after a mass shooting in Port Arthur that 
            killed 35 people. There has only been one recorded mass shooting since in 2018 involving a family of 7 in a rural town.
